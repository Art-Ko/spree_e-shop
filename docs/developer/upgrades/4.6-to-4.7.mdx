    Update all other spree gems used in your application to 4.7.0 or version compatible with 4.7:

    ```ruby
    gem 'spree_sample', '~> 4.7'
    gem 'spree_emails', '~> 4.7'

    gem 'spree_i18n', '~> 5.3'
    ```

    <Warning>
    If your Gemfile includes spree\_frontend, make sure it's defined below spree\_backend. This is required for a proper initialization of the admin action buttons defined by spree\_frontend.
